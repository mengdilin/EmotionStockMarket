##Purpose: 
Stock Market Game. Instead of trading bonds, users will be trading emotions (happy, sad, depressed, etc.). The value of a given emotion will be calculated based on its usage in Twitter posts compared to other emotions. These values will be charted and graphed (updated regularly). 

Users will be able to buy emotions with money. If a user goes bankrupt, he/she can borrow money from the central bank.
The central bank trades money for the users soul (each user starts out with 100% of their soul). (For example, 1% soul=$100.) Users will be able to buy back percentages of their soul with money that they earn from selling their stocks.

##How to Play:
<p>Step 1: Create an account
<p>Step 2: Start buying!

Every player will start off with $10,000 and 100% soul.
(For clarification: 'Soul' is a stat similar to 'Health' in other games.)
